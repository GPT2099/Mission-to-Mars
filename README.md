# Mission-to-Mars
This project creates a web app that uses functions to scrape NASA's website for articles, information, and images. A button is designed to update the app with the most recent articles. The project also displays the four full-resolution images of Mars hemispheres and their titles. The app is then adjusted for greater responsiveness.
